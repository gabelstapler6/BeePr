## Description
BeePr is an open-source android app for setting an interval timer without any bloat and fancy animations. Once the app starts a timer starts running. To change the duration of the timer simply use the tumbler wheels. You can select three predefined timer intervals using a slider to quickly change the interval of the 'beep'. The timer starts and restarts automatically so you can focus on your tasks instead of clicking an unnecessary start button. The application keeps your phone awake so you don't need to unlock it all the time during your tasks.

## Installation
- Download the latest binary from the <a href=https://github.com/gabelstapler6/BeePr/releases>Releases</a> section
- Unzip and move the .apk-file onto your android smartphone
- Run the .apk-file from inside your phone
